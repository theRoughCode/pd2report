  This report defines two types of software design, namely, the monolithic architecture and microservices architecture.  The advantages and disadvantages of both are explored and, in doing so, provides a clearer understanding of why many larger companies are making a move from a monolithic software architecture to the microservices architecture.  The report analyses Loblaw Digital's current use of a monolithic structure in its code base and the drawbacks it has on the company.  Loblaw Digital is scaling rapidly in terms of both its code base and its team size.  Its monolithic code base does not scale well and, therefore, a restructure to a microservices architecture is needed.

  Software architecture plays a major role in the success of a technology company.  The choice and design of the company's software architecture affects the scalability of the code base and the productivity of its developers.  This report focuses on 2 different types of software architecture, namely the monolithic architecture and microservices architectures.  The monolithic architecture is used at Loblaw Digital and, as a result, developers face long application start up times, the code base is complex and intimidating for new developers on the team, and continuous deployment is difficult.  Although many companies use the monolithic software architecture for their code base, there is an increasing number of companies, such as Netflix, Amazon, and PayPal (Bhatia, 2015), who are adopting the microservices architecture for various reasons explored in this report.  This report aims to examine the differences between the monolithic and microservices architecture by comparing pros and cons of each type of architecture with regards to the success of a tech comapny.  We discuss how a move to the microservices architecture could resolve the problems faced by companies such as Loblaw Digital.

  \mySection{Analysis} {
	Software architecture is the set of decisions that define the organization of a software system to achieve a solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements (Microsoft, 2009).  The initial choice of software architecture for a company has a big impact on the scalability of the code base.  Failing to consider certain requirements by choosing a certain architecture can lead to long-term consequences such as a failure to meet business requirements or a difficult deployment process.  The goal of software architecture is to create a software system that is able to meet both technical and business requirements and is flexible enough to be able to adapt to changes in requirements over time.  The monolithic and microservices architectures are two types of software architectures that are prevalent among technology companies today.  
	\mySubSection{Monolithic Architecture} {
	A monolithic software architecture is one in which the components of the software system exist within the same code base, as seen in Figure 1.  All the logic and computation occurs in one large code base which also serves as an interface for both the client, or end user, and the database.
	\myFigure{0.25}{monolithic_model}{Diagram of a monolithic architecture (Awasthi, 2017)}
		\mySubSubSection{Advantages of Monolithic Architecture} {
			Many companies adopt the monolithic architecture as it is very simple to structure and develop.  Advantages of monolithic architecture:
		\bulletpoints{
			\item Simple to develop as most IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are geared towards monolithic applications (Richardson, 2017)
			\item Simple to test.  The Selenium framework allows for end-to-end testing for web applications (Kharenko, 2015).
			\item Simple to deploy as you just have to build the application and upload it to the server.
			\item Simple to scale by running copies of the application behind a load balancer.  The load balancer splits up the workload of the application among multiple servers, increasing the amount of allowable traffic.
     	}
     	}
     	The monolithic architecture is preferred for smaller software systems as it makes it simple to design and deploy.  This allows companies to iterate over their software more frequently and ship their product to consumers faster.  However, as the code base grows, the monolithic architecture design becomes an increasing disadvantage.  
     	\mySubSubSection{Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture}  {
     	Most of the system's functionality and implementation are interwoven and have huge dependencies on one another, in other words, it has a high coupling.  This is the major disadvantage that a monolithic architecture has as good software design advocates low coupling to ensure that even if one component goes down, the other components can still function independently without crashing the entire system.   Disadvantages of monolithic architecture:
     	\bulletpoints {
			\item Complex code base decreases code readability and translates to longer onboarding times for new developers to learn the code base.
			\item Decrease in modularity due to high coupling.  A potential fix in one component could inadvertently create a bug in a dependent component.
			\item Slower development cycle because it takes a longer time for the developer to understand the issue and figure out how to correctly implement the solution.  This, in turn, results in a gradual decrease in code quality.
			\item Slower start up times due to larger application size.
			\item Continuous deployment is difficult.  A small update in one component requires redeployment of the entire system (Richardson, 2017).  The possible introduction of new errors due to high coupling further increases the risk associated with redeployment, also known as "dependency hell" (Merkel, 2014).
			\item Costly to adopt new technologies as it will affect the entire application (Kharenko, 2015).
     	}
     	}
	}
	
	\mySubSection{Microservices Architecture} {
		The microservices architecture tackles the main problems that monolithic architecture software has.  It divides your application into smaller components that work independently from one another (see Figure 2).  Each service implements one functionality, is independent from other services, can be deployed independently, and can use a different stack of technology (Bhatia, 2016).  If one service goes down, the rest of the application isn't affected.  Each service might have its own database schema which could result in duplication of data (Kharenko, 2015).  The goal of a microservice architecture is to achieve low coupling.  One way it enforces low coupling is allowing the services to communicate between themselves only through network calls, or application programming interfaces (APIs) (Newman, 2015).  The API is like a recipe or a set of instructions that allows other services to know the exact data being transferred.  The computation that occurs within each service behind the API is opaque to the other services and allows the service to function like a black box.  This provides the system with the flexibility to make changes or even revamp a component without affecting other components.
		\myFigure{0.25}{microservice_model}{Diagram of a monolithic architecture (Awasthi, 2017)}
		\mySubSubSection{Advantages of Microservices Architecture} {
			The low coupling, modularity, and flexibility that the microservices architecture gives a system is beneficial for companies looking to scale its software.  Many large tech companies, like Netflix and Amazon, have made the decision to employ the microservices architecture in their code base due to its scalability.  Here are some of the advantages that microservices architecture provides:
			\bulletpoints {
				\item Ease of deployment.  A change to a single service can be deployed independently of the other systems.  This facilitates continuous deployment for complex applications.  If there is a problem, the change can be rolled back and the error tracked easily due to the small scale of the service (Newman, 2015).  	
				\item Allows for technology diversity and flexibility (Fowler, 2017).  Different languages, frameworks, and tools can be integrated seamlessly together into the application.  Changing these technology for others can be done easily without affecting the rest of the application.  This allows the companies the freedom to choose a technology that fits the current purpose and not be bound to the choices made at the beginning of the project.  This tackles a fundamental problem with the monolithic architecture and legacy code bases that cost companies too much time and money to replace.
				\item Each service can be developed independently by a team dedicated to that service.  Having a team specializing in a service improves their productivity as it limits the scope of breadth of knowledge required, allowing them to gain better depth of knowledge regarding that service.  An additional benefit is minimizing the team size working on each service, thus optimizing the company's overall productivity (Newman, 2015).
				\item Code base is easier to understand.  The division of the complex application into smaller services allows new developers to understand the code base much easier.  Developers can focus on the particular services they will interact with during development without having to worry about the inner functionality of other services.  This greatly reduces the onboarding time required and gives way to increased scaling velocity.
			}		
		}
		\mySubSubSection{Disadvantages of Microservices Architecture} {
		Even though the microservices architecture solves many of the problems raised by the monolithic architecture, it comes with inherent problems.  Although it is helpful for scaling large applications, it complicates smaller code bases by adding unnecessary abstractions and interactions between components.  Here are some of its disadvantages:
		\bulletpoints {
			\item Introduces the complexity of a distributed system.  A distributed system can be costly to manage and each interaction through the API Gateway has to be checked for potential errors.
			\item Multiple databases owned by different services need to be updated.  Since the applications database is partitioned, transactions have to update multiple databases.  This complicates the code and creates a wider surface area for potential errors.  If one database or part of the transaction goes down, the transaction would not function as it should.  A solution to this is the eventual consistency approach.  Whenever a service updates its data, it publishes an event that other services can subscribe to.  Once notified of the change, the other services updates its data to match the published event (Richardson, 2017).  This allows for all services to be "eventually consistent", however, this approach is challenging to develop.
			\item Harder to test.  Having a distributed system of services makes testing a particular system more complicated as its dependencies have to be run for it to be tested.
			\item Difficult to implement changes across services.  Unlike in a monolithic architecture where you can integrate and deploy the changes after modifying the appropriate component, changes for a microservices architecture that affect multiple services have to be coordinated between the components.
			\item Complex deployment of the application.  Each microservice has to be configured, deployed, scaled, and monitored.  This renders a manual approach almost impossible and requires a high level of automation (Richardson, 2017).

	\mySubSection {Loblaw Digital And Software Architecture} {
     	Loblaw Digital uses the monolithic architecture in its code base.  This was a decision made early on in its early days as a new off-shoot project from Loblaws.  Loblaw Digital began its digital project back in 2013 with a small team size of { INSERT NUMBER } developers.  It operated as a startup with a huge corporate financial backing and made technical decisions fitted for a tech startup.  Specifically,  the team made the decision to use the Java programming language with Spring Boot integration for web development and SAP Hybris for content management.  Java, along with other older programming languages like C and C++, tends towards a monolithic software architecture.  Furthermore, Loblaw Digital is responsible for managing the digital platforms of its grocery stores, like Loblaws and Canadian Superstore, along with its other subsidiaries like Shoppers Drug Mart and Joe Fresh.  This results in an enormous code base that is responsible for providing the functionalities for the websites of each store.  It is quite evident that this is detrimental to the company's growth because the monolithic architecture is not suited to a software system of this scale.  \\ \\
     	Loblaw Digital's code base grows by { INSERT DATA }.  The majority of the company's massive code base is written in Java and is packaged into a single application that is deployed to the server every 2 weeks.  Having a monolithic architecture makes it easier for developers to run the whole application on their system, but requires a lot of setup time.  Setting up the necessary environment for development on the developer's local machine can take up to 3 hours!  This eats up a lot of development time and is costly to the team's productivity and the company's profits. \\ \\
     	Every minor code change in one part of the system requires days of testing the internal Automation Testing team.  The code first undergoes unit tests developed by the software developer, integration tests by the Quality Assurance engineer, followed by regression tests leading up to live deployment of the code.  All this testing has to be done over the whole application to ensure that the code change does not affect any other part of the system.  Live redeployments happen every two weeks at Loblaw Digital. This is really slow when compared with Amazon's 11.6 second release cycle, as of 2011 (Jenkins, 2011).  Continuous deployment and a fast development cycle are desirable traits that tech companies want to have as it allows for their product to reach their customer faster.  However, this is difficult to achieve because the monolithic architecture does not lend well to frequent continuous deployment. \\ \\     	
     	The size and complexity of a monolithic architecture makes it tough for new Loblaw Digital employees to learn the code base.  New developers have to understand the structure of the monolithic code base and how each component interacts with one another before being able to implement correct solutions to the code.  Loblaw Digital hires about { INSERT DATA HERE } new employees { INSERT TIME } and will continue to increase its aggressive hiring.  The monolithic architecture will be costly for the company when new developers have to take time to understand the code before starting development.\\ \\
     	As Loblaw Digital looks to scale, a shift to a microservices architecture is required.  However, this shift will take a lot of time and effort to restructure not only the code base, but also the teams.  The company will have to re-evaluate the current team organization and perform structural changes to minimize team sizes and allow each team to focus on a microservice.  A web messaging protocol, or API, will have to be clearly established to enable the teams and their software to effectively communicate with one another.  The team's automation process would have to be improved to handle the set up and deployment of the entire application and its various microservices.  All in all, the company will see a drastic shift over time in the way its software development process works as it transitions from a monolithic to microservices architecture.

  \section{Conclusions}
  {

  Loblaw Digital's monolithic architecture approach definitely worked well when it first started developing its software due to the small code base.  However, as the company is looking to scale aggressively, it needs to rethink its approach and look to restructure and rearchitect its software from monolithic to microservices architecture.

  \section{Recommendations}
  {

  Loblaw Digital is beginning to see some minor integrations of the microservices architecture into its code base.    A few smaller and newer teams are taking a shot at structuring their code with a microservices architecture.  This gives them the autonomy to develop code independently and to have a release cycle that is separated from the rest of the company.  In the coming years, more segments of Loblaw Digital's code base will be rewritten and restructured using a microservices architecture and, in the end, there will be a code base that allows the company to ship its code under 10 seconds!
